# Causal Model Forecast Driven Approach to Project Management

[#167001767](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167001767) Currently in software development / project management, the industry standard is to use the AGILE methodology. AGILE has worked wonders over the years and proven itself to be effective at organizing development teams and getting projects shipped, however there are cracks in its system that we should endeavor to iteratively improve.

Some current weaknesses of AGILE are as follows:

- Only the software development team is "agile" while the rest of the organization is not. This leads to a lots of "Agile only in spirit" teams 
- Because we don't have a deeper understanding of what complexity even is, the "points" we used to measure it becomes necessarily subjective and political, which takes away from their usefulness
- Because points aren't objective, it's not possible for one to be "wrong" with his points, thus preventing improvement 
- There is no way to quantitatively measure software quality (aka architecture) thus leading to organizations to value what John Ousterhout calls tactical programming over strategic programming


# Goals

The eventual goal of this project is to achieve a systems management framework that is:

- model-driven 
- quantitatively predictive
- objective
- reality-bound
